To-Do ===========

    Exploratory Data Analysis:
        * Make our own spectrograms from wav files
        * Plot features
        * Understand the features - Jeremy
        * Try to add more features - Jeremy
        * creating new test or train set of wav files - Jeremy
            - Look on online sources , - Careful with super res mp3->wav.
            - Why?
                - Can we make multi-mix-genre output?
                - For our own fun of categorizing our choice of songs? Test set?
                - Add new genres?

    Neural Nets:
        * Create feed-forward neural network - Almost done - Lecheng Elizabeth
        * Create convolutional neural network with residual connection - Emily/Jeremy
        * Create recurrent neural network - Lecheng
        * Create Seq2Seq with attention
            # we should pick one first
            * ask teacher or research on how to use attention
            * consider generation
        * figure out combining the nets - Emily
        * (Kmeans Clustering) - Cluster genres or songs , on the original audio - Jeremy
            - This finds if genres are closer to each other.
            - Or if songs are closer to each
             - (Would this be a graph node clustering problem?)

    Tuning Hyperparameters:
        * Learning rate
        * Batch size
        * Initialized weights

Schedule ===============
While working together, we can use JetBrains Client aka Pycharm Collaborative. It is hosted by Elizabeth.
While working separately, we work on our own IDE or Pycharm.
Create a fork for yourself. Update Project if needed.
Save changes to your fork. Create a merge/pull request.
If Lecheng has time, he will accept them. 

If not, we plan to discuss the merges in meeting. The meetings are:
Th 2-2:30 during our normal Th 2-3:30 meeting time.
(M 2-2:30) if we need to do bi-weekly updates.

    Meet: April 14 Th 12-3:30pm : Gzang Grad Lounge open area. Have done: Current small agenda: EDA, 3 models.
    Meet: April 21 Th 12-3:30pm : Gzang Grad Lounge open area.
    Meet: April 23 Sat 6pm Jeremy's House: 15 Dartmouth St., Waltham
    Due: April 27 or may 2 Monday
        Ask teacher to clarify, then followup and ask to go May2
