READ ME ABOUT ====================
eda.txt
This section will discuss some of the included features in the 2 csv files along with new features.
We intend to do some initial exploratory data analysis (eda) on the given features to better understand them. Possibly,
    we may attempt to run attention or other mechanics that will help pinpoint what features best represent genre.
New features is a section where we attempt to generate new data features from the given wav files. While some of that
    information may be implicitly embedded into the wav data, illuminating them for addition in FFNNs may show if these
    new features are strongly correlated to genre.

OLD FEATURES======================
1. What is a wav file??
    Wav file encodes recorded audio. For us: music.
    Sampling rate 44.1k, bit depth 2^16 = range[-32768, include32767 = 65536]
    At 44.1k or 48k times per second, (up to 2-4) mic/speaker envelope positions are recorded. The bit depth represents
    a breakdown of how precisely the speaker position is different from a still/0 position.

    The start of the file is 44 bytes of file format information. See source 5. For us: When we want to find the raw
        volume, we will need to not include this section. For NN, it should learn that this starting 44bytes is useless.

    After that, data chunks house speaker envelope position.

    How does this encode volume?

NEW FEATURES =====================
Features: avg vol, avg differential of vol

TODO: Be able to extract data from wav files.

Plan: try to extract avg volume level.
    Look up how Wav files are encoded.
    extract wav data. Do summation?
    Generate our own new_features.csv
    Look up what Lecheng's wavdata() does.
    Look up what Librosa does, and what its compatible with.
